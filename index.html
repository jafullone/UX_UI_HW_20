    <h2 id="about">Background</h2>
    <p>Using the design thinking process, our team worked to design a mobile application to solve a
      common problem faced. Three person teams were created, where we assigned responsibilities modeling today's
      workplace. We conducted research, prototyped and iterated on our designs, and presented to our peers.
    </p>
    <p><b>Team:</b> Jonathan I., Rich S., Lainey A., Jennifer F.</p>
    <p><b>My Role:</b> My responsibilities conducting market research, ideating solutions, included prototyping UI,
      usability testing, and presenting this solution.</p>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Research, prototype, test, and validate an idea for a brand-new mobile application that solves a real,
          clearly identified need in users’ everyday lives.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>Providing college students a secure way to report an item as either lost or found, keep record of your
          important items, and provide students a safe way to retrieve their items.

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>
          To get an understanding of the depth of this issue we reached out to students who have lost or found something
          while on a college campus. All interviewed students attended universities where no such technology existed;
          thus, for our competitor analysis we sought apps that served communties who had lost or found something.

        <h5>Methodology</h5>

  <!-- Research Findings -->

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-12">
        <h2 id="user">Understanding the Users</h2>
        <p>We observed that students:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Had more urgency to find an item if it was perceived as valuable
          </li>
          <li>Noted several ways methods used to find a lost item
          </li>
          <li>
            Felt mostly hopeless that their lost items may not be returned and unsure about how to find or return a lost

        <div class="col-12">
          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>On-campus college students are frustrated that they finding lost items isn't as simple as looking in the
            lost
            in found. The current process has proven stressful for students, who usually end up having to spend time
            going
            to each place hoping to retrieve lost items when urgently needed.</p>

          <p>Students need a more effective system of communicating lost items to the student body/campus to alleviate
            stress and a safe avenue of retrieval of items when found.

          <ol>
            <li>Items of value and urgency</li>

          <p>During the user flow process we identified that our services catered two two different individuals: someone
            who
            had lost an item and someone who had found one while on campus. This required two different user flows. </p>

          <p>Using our feature prioritization matrix and user flow as guides, we began sketching our design for the app.
            Based on what we had gathered, we knew that this prototype was to include: a way for someone who lost an
            item
            on
            campus to be alerted if the item is found; creating a backpack feature wherein students could store items to
            easily mark them as lost; a safe way for the exchange of an item that has been found.</p>

            app
          </p>
          <p>Tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Go through the process of being a person who finds an item and successfully reports it</li>
            <li>Go through the process of being a person who loses an item and uses the app without making an account
            </li>

          <h4>Usability Testing Analysis</h4>
          <p>We found that we needed to focus on being clear with how the buttons are labeled as well as reassess the
            current user flow and make improvements. We also realized, based on user feedback, that there were
            considerations to be made regarding the appropriateness of accounts.</p>

        <div class="col-6">
          <h4>User Feedback</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Terminology used on buttons were confusing</li>
            <li>A little confusing when you lose something without an account, especially with backpack</li>
            <li>Some of the back buttons do not work otherwise really great layout</li>

        <p>After analyzing and prioritizing the user feedback, I iterated over the design and updated the prototype.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Working on Find and Seek project was exciting and resonated with problems we've all faced; we actually based
        this off of a team member’s recent experience. Throughout this project, we learned how to hone in the user flow
        aspect of the design process, which also proved to be challenging. By understanding the needs of each archetype
        and how they all interact, we were able to continually improve the app.
      </p>
      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjusting the terminology on the buttons to be more clear</li>
        <li>Turning the logo into a "Home" button</li>
        <li>Making the bottom menu functional </li>
        <li>Create screens for Ordering stickers and other tags for Backpack items</li>
        <li>Implement testing in a university environment.</li>
        <li> Ways for non-account holders to track their items in-app</li>
      </ul>
